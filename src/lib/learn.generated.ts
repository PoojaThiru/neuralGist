   "summary": "This workshop applies conditional probability, Bayes' theorem, total probability, and independence to six diverse problems without hints about which method to use. You'll learn to recognize when to use Bayes (and when not to), identify valid partitions, compute independence rigorously rather than guessing, and handle sequential problems where probabilities update. After this lesson, you'll be able to tackle conditional probability problems on exams where the tool isn't announced—the core skill of applied probability.",

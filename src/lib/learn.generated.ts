   "summary": "This workshop puts conditional probability theory into practice with six realistic problems that don't tell you which tool to use—testing your ability to identify when to apply Bayes' theorem, total probability, independence tests, or basic conditional logic. You'll work through common traps like reversing conditionals, confusing overlap in probabilities, and mistaking conditional problems for Bayes problems, then apply these insights to sensor defect scenarios and the classic three-box switching problem. After watching, you'll be able to pick the right probability tool for unfamiliar problems and avoid the three mistakes that cost the most marks on exams.",

After this lesson, you'll be able to import real data reliably without creating duplicates or silent failures.",
